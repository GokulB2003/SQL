# 📊 SQL Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions in SQL perform calculations on multiple rows of a table’s column and return a single value.

They are commonly used with the `GROUP BY` clause.

# 🧾 Sample Table: `employees`

| id | name  | department | salary |
| -- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |

```

**Output:**

| SUM(salary) |
| ----------- |
| 250000      |

---

## 3️⃣ AVG()

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
```

**Output:**

| AVG(salary) |
| ----------- |
| 50000       |

---

## 4️⃣ MIN()

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
```

**Output:**

| MIN(salary) |
| ----------- |
| 40000       |

---

## 5️⃣ MAX()

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```

**Output:**

| MAX(salary) |
| ----------- |
| 60000       |

# 🔹 Using GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions

```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

**Output:**

| department | total_salary |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| IT         | 110000       |
| HR         | 85000        |
| Finance    | 55000        |

# 🔹 Using HAVING Clause

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter grouped results.

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 45000;
```
